        <center><h2> DETAILS ABOUT THE MODEL </h2></center>
                <li><p>From the practicals a simple agent-based model (ABM) was built. The model demonstrated the key themes likely to come across in building such a model like branching,
                       looping, moving agents,animation, communications,input and outputs, variables among others but also provided more general code for dealing with spatial, and other, data.
                       ABMs are probably the most popular modelling techniques in the social and ecological sciences.</p></li>
